dehydrated wood mod for terraria

dehydrated wood is a quality of life mod with the goal of closing the gap between starting with copper tools and reaching higher tier ores like tungsten. in modded versions of the game, particularly mods like calamity mod, the time spent at the beginning can get very boring and stop people from continuing on their journey. i hope this mod will help you if you are one of them.
