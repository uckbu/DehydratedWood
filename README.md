dehydrated wood mod for terraria

dehydrated wood is a quality of life mod with the goal of closing the gap between starting with copper tools and reaching higher tier ores like tungsten. in modded versions of the game, particularly mods like calamity mod, the time spent at the beginning can get very boring and prevent players from continuing on their journey. Having a quick way of jumping through the meaningless power levels that are only relevant in base game terraria would hopefully change that, thus the creation of this mod

(its because i got annoyed)
